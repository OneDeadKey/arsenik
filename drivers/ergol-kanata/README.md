# Ergo-L Kanata driver

An Ergo-L "portable" driver, emulated with Kanata over your regular keymap.

## Caveats

- Only Azerty-FR is supported as the base keymap at this point.
- Mac keyboards are not supported at this point.
- "Useless" right-hand keys are not remapped at this point; they should
  ideally be remapped to their Qwerty/Ergo-L counterparts.
- Some exotic characters may be missing, please report bugs.
- Layer taps are not supported at this point.
- Home row mods are not supported at this point.
