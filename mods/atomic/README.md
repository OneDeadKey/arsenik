An experiment to modularize Arsenik and bring more features, e.g.
angle mods, Vim-like navigation layer, Mac/Azerty/Qwertz support, etc.

- load `kanata.kbd`
- enable each feature by un-commenting the related line
- live-reload the configuration with Space+Backspace (requires layer-taps)

Configuration options:

- key arrangement: Mac or PC, with or without angle mod?
- base layer: standard, layer-taps, homerow mods?
- symbols layer: AltGr, QWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY?
- navigation layer: ESDF or HJKL?

This should work exactly like Arsenik by default, except Escape and Enter have
been swapped.
